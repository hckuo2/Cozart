Instructions for Apache-Reload Release Manager

0.  Ask the PMC to verify that you have the appropriate CPAN permissions
    on dev@perl.

    If this is your first release, ask someone with APML karma on PAUSE
    to verify you have the appropriate permissions.  Likely someone on
    the PMC can do this.

    a. login into https://pause.perl.org
    b. menu click: Select Mailinglist/Action
    c. choose APML and Change Permissions and click go
    d. click 3.1 Make somebody else co-maintainer
    e. choose the modules to give the perms to
       type the username of the new co-maintainer
    f. if you happen to know that packages were added this release,
       make sure you give the correct permissions to them.

     MAINTAINER_BUILDING_RELEASE=1 perl Makefile.PL

1. 'make disttest' - to make sure nothing is missing from the manifest.
   Now 'make dist', and test this generated package (not svn)
   with as many configurations as possible on as many platforms
   as possible.

  a. edit ./Changes:
     - change -dev to -rc\d+ starting with -rc1

  b. nuke any preinstalled Apache-Reload libs and run 'make test'

  c. test that you can 'make install' and then run 'make test' again

  d. test whether we still 100% OK on systems with no LWP:

     % APACHE_TEST_PRETEND_NO_LWP=1 make test

2. once confident that the package is good, upload a release candidate
   to people.apache.org/~username and post 24 hour-ish candidate alert
   to the various lists

     o dev/perl.apache.org
     o modperl/perl.apache.org

  Subject: [RELEASE CANDIDATE] Apache-Reload 0.13 RC\d+

   (or maybe longer to give most people a chance to catch up). no need
   to tag this package

  a. if problems are detected during stage 2, repeat stages 1 and 2.

3. when the package has been reported to be good, prepare a new
   package to be released

  a. edit ./Changes
     - remove -rc\d+
     - add release date

  b. rerun:
     % perl Makefile.PL
     make sure tag looks right
     % make -n tag

  c. commit Changes
     % svn ci Changes

  d. tag
     % make tag

  e. create the final package
     % make dist

  f. test the final package again at least once

4. Upload the package to CPAN

5. Announce the package

  a. post ... to the modperl, announce lists
  Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Apache-Reload 0.13
     include 
  - MD5 sig (as it comes from CPAN upload announce).
  - the latest Changes

6. Prepare for the next cycle

  a. increment version in lib/Apache/Reload.pm and lib/Apache2/Reload.pm also

  b. edit ./Changes:
     - start a new item with incremented version + '-dev'

  =item 0.14-dev

  c. bump up version numbers in this file to make it easier to do the
     next release.

     $ perl -pi -e 's/(\d+)\.(\d+)/join(".", $1, $2+1)/eg' RELEASE

     (undo the change to the PAUSE menu item number in item 0d. above)

  d. commit Changes
     % svn ci -m "start 0.13-dev cycle" Changes RELEASE \
       lib/Apache/Reload.pm lib/Apache2/Reload.pm
