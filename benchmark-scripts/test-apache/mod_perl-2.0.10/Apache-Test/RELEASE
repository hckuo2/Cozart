Instructions for Apache-Test Release Manager

0.  Ask the PMC to verify that you have the appropriate CPAN permissions
    on test-dev@.

1. 'make dist' - to make sure nothing is missing from the manifest,
   etc. Now test this generated package (not svn) with as many
   configurations as possible on as many platforms as possible.

  a. edit ./Changes:
     - change -dev to -rc\d+ starting with -rc1
     - note that you *do not* want to change the version in Apache/Test.pm,
       this is a significant difference than other Apache::* modules.
       this means that development proceeds with non '-dev' or '-rc1' version
       tags, so keep that in mind.

  b. nuke any preinstalled Apache-Test libs and run 'make test'

  c. test that you can 'make install' and then run 'make test' again

  d. test whether we still 100% OK on systems with no LWP:

     % APACHE_TEST_PRETEND_NO_LWP=1 make test

2. once confident that the package is good, upload a release candidate
   to perl.apache.org/~username and post 24 hour-ish candidate alert
   to the various lists.  note that you will need to be subscribed to
   all of the following lists.

     o test-dev/perl.apache.org
     o dev/perl.apache.org
     o modperl/perl.apache.org
     o dev/httpd.apache.org

   (or maybe longer to give most people a chance to catch up). no need
   to tag this package

   Subject: [RELEASE CANDIDATE] Apache-Test-1.40 RC\d+

  a. if problems are detected during stage 2, repeat stages 1 and 2.

3. when the package has been reported to be good, prepare a new
   package to be released

  a. edit ./Changes:
     - remove -rc\d+
     - add release date

  b. rerun:
     % perl Makefile.PL
     make sure tag looks right
     % make -n tag

  c. commit Changes
     % svn ci Changes

  d. tag
     % make tag

  e. create the final package
     % make dist

  f. test the final package again at least once

4. Upload the package to CPAN

5. Announce the package

  a. post ... to the modperl, announce lists
  Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Apache-Test 1.40
     include 
  - MD5 sig (as it comes from CPAN upload announce).
  - the latest Changes

6. Prepare for the next cycle

  a. increment version in lib/Apache/Test.pm

  b. edit ./Changes:
     - start a new item with incremented version + '-dev'

  =item 1.41-dev

  c. bump up version numbers in this file to make it easier to do the
     next release.

     $ perl -pi -e 's/(\d+)\.(\d+)/join(".", $1, $2+1)/eg' RELEASE

  d. commit Changes
     % svn ci -m "start 1.40-dev cycle" Changes RELEASE lib/Apache/Test.pm
